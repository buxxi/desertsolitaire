=== Desert Walk Solitaire ===
A solitaire made in HTML,LESS and JS that is always possible to win.
High score is saved to localStorage so clearing browser history and such will erase it :(
Made as a demo for the css+svg playing cards I created github.com/buxxi/playingcards.css
(I don't really know the real name for it in english, this is just a translation of the name I know it from in swedish: Ã–kenvandringen).

=== Rules ===
Match the empty spaces with the card following the one to the left in suit and number.
When there are no more moves you can reshuffle the cards that is in incorrect order and the others will stay in place.
Score is ordered by lowest time first.
